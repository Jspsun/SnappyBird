# SnappyBird
I had some spare time so I figured: What better way to spend an afternoon than building the game that was the bane of my existence


## What I Made
The project is pretty much what it sounds like. I took the tried and true flappy bird, built it in JS and then added in the ability to control the bird by snapping.


## What I used
..* javascript
..* p5 framework
..* a tiny tiny bit of html for the index file

## TODO
..* Improve visual feedback when pipes are hit
..* Add counter for each pipe passed
..* Add in graphics for pipe and bird
..* Add in graphics for background

## Completed tasks (date completed)
..* Set up initial flappy bird (Nov 2, 2016)
..* Improve pipe generation (Nov 2, 2016)
..* Add snapping functionality (Nov 3, 2016)
